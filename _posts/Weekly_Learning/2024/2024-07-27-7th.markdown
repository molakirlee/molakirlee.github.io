### 科学


### 言论
1. 王传福多年前关于造车的一句话给了我很大的勇气。他说很多企业因为不了解，会把技术想象到令人畏惧的高度，这种畏惧正是对手给后来者营造了一种产业恐吓。他们不断地告诉你做不成，投入很大，研发很难，直到你放弃。其实你解决不了的不是因为你没有能力，而是你缺乏勇气。 -- [雷军](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/roll/2024-07-23/doc-incfcpey8084281.shtml)
1. 心理学家做过一个实验，让实验者长期处于半饥饿状态。结果，这些实验者的心理发生了永久变化。实验结束后，很多人喜欢上了烹饪书和餐馆菜单，会认真比较报纸上的水果和蔬菜价格，甚至开始重新考虑自己的职业，改为从事农业或餐饮。心理学家说，这证明了人被自己缺乏的东西所吸引。 -- [A utopian strand of economic thought is making a surprising comeback](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24065976/economists-post-scarcity-abundance-industrial-revolution-socialism-capitalism)
1. AI 的危险在于，它让你跳过思考，让机器填补思想的空白。我们需要 AI 使我们增加思考，而不是减少思考。我们每外包一个想法，就会错失一次成长的机会。 -- [TURNING THE TABLES ON AI](https://ia.net/topics/turning-the-tables-on-ai)
1. 费马大定理是一个极困难的数学猜想，自从1637年提出后，直到1993年才解决。这个定理没有任何实际应用，只是用来提醒人们数学是多么深奥。 -- [The Fermat's Last Theorem Project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/FLT-announcement/)
1. 简单性是一种优点，但糟糕的是，复杂的东西卖得更好。 -- [Simplicity is An Advantage but Sadly Complexity Sells Better](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/simplicity/)
1. The real world is muddy and messy and full of things that we do not yet understand. It is much easier for a scientist to sit in an air-conditioned building and run computer models, than to put on winter clothes and measure what is really happening outside in the swamps and the clouds. That is why the climate model experts end up believing their own models. -- [FREEMAN DYSON( Professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton)](https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-heretical-thoughts-about-science-and-society)
1. Science is organized unpredictability. The best scientists like to arrange things in an experiment to be as unpredictable as possible, and then they do the experiment to see what will happen. You might say that if something is predictable then it is not science.  -- [FREEMAN DYSON( Professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton)](https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-heretical-thoughts-about-science-and-society)

### 观点
###### [The Surprising Power of The Long Game](https://fs.blog/long-game/)
1. 这个世界上，大多数人都在玩短期游戏。如果你玩长期游戏，你会因此获得优势。
2. 这是因为，如果你做其他人正在做的事情，回报应该跟其他人差不多，只能保证你获得平均结果，除非你很幸运。
3. 要想获得高于其他人的回报，你要么做不同的事情，要么以不同的方式做事。
4. 选择很少人玩的长期游戏，你更容易获得高于其他人的回报。这不是因为它更简单，事实上它更困难，但是你每天都投入去做困难的事情，会使得明天变得更容易。
5. 长期游戏最困难的地方是第一步。你必须愿意承受当前的痛苦，才能让明天变得更容易一点。
6. 在长期游戏中，你每天只能创造出一点微小的优势，它不明显但不意味着不存在。
7. 你不能在所有事情上都进行长期游戏。你需要选择对你来说重要的事情，做一个长期规划，然后长期投入。

###### [克里克从物理转生物的经历](https://www.edge.org/conversation/freeman_dyson-heretical-thoughts-about-science-and-society)
Sixty years ago, when I was a young and arrogant physicist, I tried to predict the future of physics and biology. My prediction was an extreme example of wrongness, perhaps a world record in the category of wrong predictions. I was giving advice about future employment to Francis Crick, the great biologist who died in 2005 after a long and brilliant career. He discovered, with Jim Watson, the double helix. They discovered the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, and thereby gave birth to the new science of molecular genetics. Eight years before that, in 1945, before World War 2 came to an end, I met Francis Crick for the first time. He was in Fanum House, a dismal office building in London where the Royal Navy kept a staff of scientists. Crick had been working for the Royal Navy for a long time and was depressed and discouraged. He said he had missed his chance of ever amounting to anything as a scientist. Before World War 2, he had started a promising career as a physicist. But then the war hit him at the worst time, putting a stop to his work in physics and keeping him away from science for six years. The six best years of his life, squandered on naval intelligence, lost and gone forever. Crick was good at naval intelligence, and did important work for the navy. But military intelligence bears the same relation to intelligence as military music bears to music. After six years doing this kind of intelligence, it was far too late for Crick to start all over again as a student and relearn all the stuff he had forgotten. No wonder he was depressed. I came away from Fanum House thinking, “How sad. Such a bright chap. If it hadn’t been for the war, he would probably have been quite a good scientist”. 

A year later, I met Crick again. The war was over and he was much more cheerful. He said he was thinking of giving up physics and making a completely fresh start as a biologist. He said the most exciting science for the next twenty years would be in biology and not in physics. I was then twenty-two years old and very sure of myself. I said, “No, you’re wrong. In the long run biology will be more exciting, but not yet. The next twenty years will still belong to physics. If you switch to biology now, you will be too old to do the exciting stuff when biology finally takes off”. Fortunately, he didn’t listen to me. He went to Cambridge and began thinking about DNA. It took him only seven years to prove me wrong. The moral of this story is clear. Even a smart twenty-two-year-old is not a reliable guide to the future of science. And the twenty-two-year-old has become even less reliable now that he is eighty-two.
