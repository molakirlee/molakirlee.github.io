###### [A Summary of My Learnings On How To Find Startup Ideas](https://liorn.substack.com/p/a-summary-of-my-learnings-on-how)
There are some tip about "how to get startup ideas". Some of them are from Paul Graham’s blog.
1. Build something you want i.e. solve your own problem
1. The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else.
1. Live in the future, then build what's missing.
1. Turn off your “unsexy problems” filter.
1. Turn off your “schlep” filter i.e. your filter for tasks that are tedious or unpleasant.
1. Ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying "Why doesn't someone make x? If someone made x we'd buy it in a second.”
1. Go through every job you ever had:What are the unique skills you learned?What seemed broken?What did you develop in-house?
1. Look for things that have changed in the world recently e.g. new technological changes, new regulations, new problems in the world.
1. Brainstorm with friends.
1. Unbundling larger platforms 
1. Senior managers tend to be a good source of knowing what their problems are and what’s holding back their performance
1. Trawl through the last YC Startup Directory list and figure out what might fit your particular favourite domain, with some modification
1. Audience: Brainstorm personas you identify with or wish to help, then I look at market research to find the obstacles they face.
