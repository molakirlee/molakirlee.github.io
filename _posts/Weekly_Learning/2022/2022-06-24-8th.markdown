### 言论
1. The scariest moment is always just before you start. -- Stephen King
1. Normality is a fine ideal for those who have no imagination. -- C.G. Jung\
1. Congratulations, you're curious and have an intellectual appetite!Since we're not given the opportunity to choose the world we live in, the least we could do is try to understand it. -- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30928948)
1. One has to specialize in some things to make money. I always tell my kids: You need to learn a trick that your are better at than others so someone will pay you to do it. Then you can pay others to do things you find boring or difficult. Of course you want to focus on something you find fun. If they get older I'd recommend them to keep consciously thinking about what gives them energy and what drains it. It's what my career coaches always told me (I was fortunate enough to work at a company that supplied coaches to everyone). Is it really more complex than that?My tip would be to look for a company where you get the opportunity to "transform" (a large company's research department for example?), and then to sometimes just give it a year when you don't like your current position. Talk to people, go to conferences, try to learn if there is work out there with the right balance of old vs new for you. -- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30929422)
