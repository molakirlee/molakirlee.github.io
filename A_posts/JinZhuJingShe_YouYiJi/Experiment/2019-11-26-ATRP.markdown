### pSBMA
1. Fabric-BiBB was dispersed in the mixture of water (30 mL) and methanol (30 mL) by sonication. 
1. After the addition of bpy (122.7 mg) and SBMA monomer (1g) into the suspension, the solution was degassed for three time through the typical freeze-pump-thaw process. 
1. Then, CuBr (21.6 mg) was added into the above solution, and the whole system was degassed another three times. 
1. The reaction was carried out at 60 C for 24 h. 
1. After the ATRP reaction for the predetermined time, the substrates were removed and sequentially washed with DI water and ethanol twice and air-dried before use.
