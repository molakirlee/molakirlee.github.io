<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Davis Corporation contracted jEO &amp; Associates to analyze the
profitability of constructing a new ethylene oxide plant.
Additionally, jEO was charged with the task of designing the most
profitable reactor system if market conditions are indeed promising.
Davis Corporation projected that the plant can be constructed in two
years and that the market demand at this time will be approximately
150,000 tons/year.</P>

<P>After a preliminary analysis, jEO determined that market
conditions were favorable enough to make a new EO plant sufficiently
profitable. Following extensive research, the direct-oxidation
process using pure oxygen and the typically used silver/alumina
catalyst was chosen and a detailed design was constructed. The
recommended design requires a capital investment of $9.3 million,
operates on any annual cost of $92 million and is projected to yield
a $350 profit in present day dollars after 15 years of production (17
years after construction begins). jEO recommends that construction of
these facilities begin immediately.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Ethylene Oxide Importance (Market
Analysis)</B></FONT></P>

<P>Many companies produce ethylene oxide (EO), an important commodity
chemical. A small portion of the direct ethylene oxide product is
used as a general disinfectant of finer instruments, sterilizer for
medical purposes, and as a fumigant in the spices industry (10).
Approximately 98% of ethylene oxide is further processed to make the
chemicals tabulated in Figure 1 (adapted from reference 15). Since
ethylene oxide is an essential component for these consumer products,
ethylene oxide will continue to be in high demand into the new
millennium.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER>

<P>The Gulf Coast area is an ideal location for a new ethylene oxide
plant. This is an area of continuous growth for the chemical and
petrochemical industries. Since there are many chemical industries
producing necessary chemical feedstock for ethylene oxide production,
choosing this location for the future plant will allow for easy
availability and transport of feed. The current available pipelines
in the south allow for easy accessibility of chemicals. This area is
also ideal for the ethylene oxide sales and distribution. Many
companies in this area use ethylene oxide to produce other chemicals.
Since the plant will be available for the surrounding companies, the
outlook projection for the ethylene oxide business is high. If
shipment of the product is necessary, the many waterways in the area
allow for easy transportation to domestic and international
businesses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A Union Carbide representative describes the current ethylene
oxide market as being slightly low this year (13). Since prices are
slightly lower and competition for ethylene oxide production is low,
the current year is an ideal time to begin development and
construction of the plant. Market predictions indicate that the
demand for EO will increase in approximately two years. Development
of a new EO plant this year will result in a start-up in
approximately two years, as the market embarks on an upswing in
demand for EO.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>EO Production in Industry</B></FONT></P>

<P>Ethylene oxide production is an old process that has gone through
one major change throughout its life. The basic goal is still the
same, to react ethylene and oxygen either directly or indirectly to
produce ethylene oxide and several undesirable by-products.
Initially, this was accomplished by the World War I era chlorohydrin
process. In modern times, EO is produced by the direct oxidation of
ethylene.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Direct Oxidation Process</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>Lefort was the first to synthesize ethylene oxide through the
direct oxidation of oxygen and ethylene in the early 1930&#146;s.
This process became popular commercially, and still is the most
common method of making ethylene oxide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The reactions above govern the direct vapor-phase oxidation of
ethylene to ethylene oxide over a silver catalyst. The main
byproducts of the reactions are carbon dioxide and water. Two other
side reactions also occur in the reactor, which are the isomerization
of acetaldehyde and production of formaldehyde. This initial proposal
does not account for the amounts of these two products, typically
less than 0.1% acetaldehyde and even less formaldehyde in the total
amount of reaction products (12). This design process uses the direct
oxidation process to synthesize ethylene oxide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Air-based vs. Oxygen-based
Process</I></B></FONT></P>

<P>Different industries use either air or oxygen as feed streams to
obtain an oxygen source to react ethylene with oxygen. jEO &amp;
Associates need to consider whether to use air or oxygen for its
source of oxygen feed. The oxygen-based process is chosen due to its
many advantages. For all plant capacities and a given type of
catalyst, the oxygen-based reactor yields a higher selectivity and
requires less catalyst (10). Although the air-based process may cost
lower to run (for small to medium-sized plants), the initial building
costs of the air-based plant is much more than the oxygen-based plant
(10). While the oxygen-based process requires a carbon dioxide
removal section, more stainless steel, and some expensive
instrumentation, the air-based process requires more catalyst, more
reactors (to achieve a comparable selectivity), a multi-stage
compressor, air purification units, a vent gas treating system, and
two to three reactor train in series (12).</P>

<P>In spite of the extra equipment for the air-based process, the
production level of ethylene oxide for an air-based process is still
less than the oxygen-based process. The average selectivity ranges
from 65-75% compared to 70-80% for the oxygen-based process.
Furthermore, the oxygen-based plants can have a yield of up to 0.1 kg
ethylene oxide per kg ethylene more than the air-based plants (12).
Due to this reason, the oxygen-based process is a more attractive
choice.</P>

<P>The air-based process has the gas purge stream, which contains
ethylene that requires extra treatment before it can be vented to the
atmosphere. This extra air pollution is not part of the oxygen-based
process (5). The cycle gas purge stream of the oxygen-based process
is usually small enough to be burned without too many pollution
problems (8). The pure oxygen process poses less potential problem
for the air.</P>

<P>Since the silver catalyst is expensive, the length of catalyst
life is an important consideration. For the oxygen oxidation, the
catalyst lasts longer and less is required for the catalyst charge
(12). The air-based oxidation generally needs 1.5 times the catalyst
charge of the other process. The required amount of catalyst and
length of catalyst life also makes the oxygen-based process a more
economically viable choice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Safety and Environmental Issues</B></FONT></P>

<P>In the gaseous state, ethylene oxide easily condenses into liquid
state at low temperatures. It is miscible with water, alcohol, ether,
and most organic solvents (10). As a vapor, it is very flammable and
explosive. Due to the highly strained cyclic structure of an ethylene
oxide molecule, it is a very reactive compound. Plant hardware must
be carefully chosen to avoid accidents and injuries. Caution must be
used in the production process, storage, handling and transport of
the chemical (5).</P>

<P>Ethylene oxide is the simplest cyclic ether, which is colorless as
a gas and liquid. At higher concentrations, it can be detected by a
slightly sweet smell. It can decompose even in the absence of air or
oxygen. At certain temperatures, ethylene oxide will polymerize,
releasing approximately 900 Btu/lb of reactant. Since rust and strong
alkali are the catalysts for this exothermic reaction, the plant
process must be designed so that ethylene oxide does not come in
contact with those substances.</P>

<P>Direct skin contact results in blistering and severe skin damage,
depending on how long the contamination occurs. Ethylene oxide can
penetrate leather, particular kinds of rubber, as well as cloth.
These items must be removed from the body immediately if exposed to
the chemical. Short-term inhalation effects of ethylene oxide include
drowsiness, disorientation, nausea, limb weakness, vomiting, and
convulsions. These temporary conditions of ethylene oxide disappear
within a few days after the limited chemical exposure. The action
level of these effects include 0.5 parts per million over an eight
hour time-weighted average (3).</P>

<P>Even in lower concentrations, long-term exposure of ethylene oxide
leaves lasting effects on humans. The chemical is generally regarded
as dangerous for the central nervous system, reproduction, genetic
effects, and cancer (3). Laboratory research has shown the substance
to increase the risk of leukemia, stomach, and brain cancer in
animals. Ethylene oxide has also been shown to decrease the
reproductive activity of laboratory rats and mice. Studies cite the
chemical as especially harmful to the male reproductive system, as it
causes lasting mutations.</P>

<P>Since ethylene oxide is highly reactive, it does not remain in the
environment for long following an accidental release or leak.
Hydrolysis of the chemical (resulting in ethylene glycol) only occurs
in more acidic solutions and specific temperatures. Studies have
shown that ethylene oxide and its derivatives biodegrade to
approximately 53% in a span of twenty days (3). The effects of these
chemicals are moderate to plants, microorganisms, and fish, causing
some mutagenic and toxic effects (5). Ethylene oxide spilled into the
soil eventually evaporates, especially if the soil is saturated with
rainwater. In water systems, the substance will simultanaeously
evaporate and mix with the water at the surface. Overall, due to the
high reactivity level, the possible release of ethylene oxide does
not pose many threats to the environment.</P>

<P>The design models a process based on a four-part system developed
by the conventional Shell direct oxidation technology. This basic
design contains the following parts: the reaction system, absorption
system, CO2 Removal Section, and EO purification system. This
proposal focuses on developing and optimizing the reactor system.</P>

<P>The reaction system involves four shell-and-tube packed plug flow
reactors, which contain silver/alumina catalyst. The feed flows are
high-purity grade oxygen and ethylene. The catalyst eases the partial
oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide and the complete combustion
of ethylene to carbon dioxide and water. The selectivity of the
ethylene oxide formation is around 81%, while the ethylene conversion
to EO is around 10%. Since the reactions are exothermic, water is
used as a cooling medium on the shell side of the reactor and is
later used to produce large quantities of low-pressure steam.</P>

<P>In jEO&#146;s design, the absorption system and CO2 Removal
section is included with the reaction system in order to produce a
realistic model of the recycle stream feed for the reactor. Since
these areas were not within the scope of the project, the absorption
of EO and water and the removal of CO2 were assumed to be ideal, with
100% removal of EO, and 100% removal of the total amount of CO2
flowing through the CO2 removal section.</P>

<P>The simplified and detailed design can be seen in the Figures 2
and 3 on the following pages. Additionally, the detailed process
information can be found in the Appendix. It contains all stream data
and information for a typical reactor.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Reactor Feed Preheat/ Effluent
Cooler</B></FONT></P>

<P>The Pre-heat exchanger&#146;s main purpose is to pre-heat the
inlet feed from 181<SUP>o</SUP>F to 266<SUP> o</SUP>F. This is
accomplished efficiently by pre-heating the feed in the tube side
while simultaneously cooling the reactor effluent from
482<SUP>o</SUP>F to 408<SUP>o</SUP>F. The pre-heat temperature is
selected based on previous research performed by a previous
engineering team, EO and Sons, studying ethylene oxide production.
Although a high reactor inlet temperature is desired, EO and Sons
concluded that the heat exchanger surface area needed for any higher
temperature required the use of an excessive amount of large and
costly heat exchangers. The heat exchanger pressures are determined
by the optimal reactor pressures. The tube side inlet pressure is 261
psia, and the shell side inlet pressure is 243 psia. The pressures
are determined by the reactor pressure requirements.</P>

<P>Stainless steel is chosen for both the tube and shell sides
because there is a large amount of EO flowing through the shell and
possible trace amounts of EO in the tube side. EO is very reactive
with rust and thus the use of stainless steel is critical to avoid a
hazardous situation.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Reactor</B></FONT></P>

<P><B><I>Reaction Chemistry and Kinetics</I></B></P>

<P>Two reactions for ethylene oxide production were considered for
the reactor system, which can be seen in Table 1. The main reaction
is the formation of ethylene oxide from ethylene, with approximately
81% selectivity towards this reaction. The second reaction is the
combustion of ethylene to carbon dioxide. The specifications for the
system were to obtain approximately 10% conversion of ethylene and a
30-50% conversion of oxygen within the selectivity range stated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The kinetics of the system are determined in order to begin the
design of the reactor. Through the use of Arrhenius kinetics, the
reactions are modeled based on given activation energies from
literature (7). Pre-exponential factors need to be obtained in order
to complete the kinetic design. The pre-exponential factors are
determined using an iterative method. First, a base case is built in
HYSYS in order to calibrate the reactor design. The
Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations of state are selected since they are
commonly used, and all simulated components are compatible in this
set for HYSYS. Literature values are needed to obtain an idea of the
total reactor tube volume to reactor inlet flow rate ratio. These
figures are necessary to obtain an estimate for the residence time
associated with typical literature values for conversion and
selectivity. Since literature usually provides product flow rate to
reactor volume correlation, a conversion reactor is used to solve for
the inlet flow rate to reactor volume ratio. This type of reactor
simply performs a mass and energy balance given the individual
conversions for each reaction. With a residence time, inlet flow to
reactor volume ratio and kinetic data obtained from Kenson (7), the
pre-exponential terms are solved for a typical industrial reactor.
These values are used to develop a plug flow kinetic model to replace
the conversion model. The following table shows the kinetic data for
the reactor:</P>

</P></CENTER>

<P>These values allow for the selectivity and conversion to stay
within range, allowing selectivity of the ethylene oxide formation to
be high, while obtaining a relatively low conversion per pass. The
selectivity of the synthesis reaction is maintained at around 81%.
Approximately 12% of the ethylene is converted per pass, while 40% of
the oxygen is converted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Catalyst</I></B></P>

<P>The catalyst is an important part of the reaction mechanism
because it determines the heterogeneous kinetics. Silver/alumina
catalyst is the type of catalyst used, which drives the selectivity
of the reactions towards ethylene oxidation. The silver allows for
oxygen adsorption on its surface, which forms an ionized superoxide.
The ethylene is reactive with this superoxide, resulting in the
formation of ethylene oxide (4).</P>

<P>Although there are several variations of silver/alumina catalyst
available, average values provided in the literature are used.
Unfortunately, data on specific catalysts is proprietary and very
difficult to obtain. This situation did not allow for any reliable or
supportable comparisons between catalysts. jEO therefore models the
catalyst in a manner to produce conservative results and uses
catalyst properties consistent with the literature values for the
classic Shell direct oxidation catalyst. This catalyst is capable of
producing the 12% conversion and 81% selectivity desired. The change
out time for this catalyst is approximately three years. One catalyst
that jEO feels should be studied in the future is a fairly new
catalyst that is capable of 86-87% selectivity with a reduced change
out time of one year. Due to time and data constraints, jEO is not
able to provide a satisfactory evaluation of this option.</P>

<P>Catalyst physical properties are modeled since they play a
significant role in reactor performance and pressure drop. A higher
catalyst density leads to an increased reaction rate, but
unfortunately produces a higher pressure drop. Therefore an accurate
representation of the catalyst properties in the model is crucial to
obtaining accurate results.</P>

<P>The following table shows the details of the catalyst sizing that
are used in the reactor:</P>

<P>The results obtained with these catalyst properties are in line
with the literature values. The pressure drop in jEO&#146;s model is
14.2 psia. Industry correspondance states that a typical pressure
drop across a reactor should be between 10-20 psia (13). Therefore,
the model appears to be reasonable in regards to yet a third
parameter in addition to conversion and selectivity.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Design Details</I></B></P>

<P>Vertical plug flow shell-and-tube reactors are used for the
system. Plug flow reactors are the most common reactors currently
being used in industry for ethylene oxide production (13), since they
allow for high velocities to be used and require less volume than
other types of reactors. Since the reactions are exothermic, a
shell-and-tube reactor design is ideal because it allows for coolant
to be run through the shell side for heat exchange. This is critical
in reducing hot spot formation, and more importantly in preventing
the reactor temperature from running away (4). Hot spots cause severe
catalyst degredation, and runaway temperatures can lead to
catastrophic process failures. Therefore, the process feed flows
through the tube side, while the cooling medium flows through the
shell side. The reactors are vertical in order to provide back
pressure for the system. This helps to keep the catalyst in
place.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The parameters of the reactors are determined based on achieving
the objectives of approximately 10% ethylene conversion and 81%
selectivity. These values are typical in the literature and have been
proven to yield an efficient consumption of the reactants. Using the
developed kinetic model for the dominant reactions, the reactor
parameters are optimized. jEO&#146;s design includes a total of four
reactors that are run in parallel. This design is superior to one
large reactor because smaller reactors are less expensive to
construct. Furthermore, this design allows for a smaller and less
expensive spare which is crucial to reduce the threat of unexpected
business interruptions. Each of these reactors contain 1712 tubes,
which are 38 ft long and have a 0.13 ft inner diameter and a wall
thickness of 0.017 ft. The tube diameters are consistent with the
industry standard, and the number and length of the tubes are
determined by rigorous simulation in HYSYS. These two parameters are
selected in order to obtain the desired conversion and selectivity
while maintaining an acceptable pressure drop.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>It is determined that the inlet temperature should be 268<SUP>
o</SUP>F (based on preheat exchanger limitations&#151;see Reactor
Feed Preheat/Effluent Cooler section) with an outlet temperature of
482<SUP> o</SUP>F. The reactor operates at 231 psia. Literature

<P><B><I>Cooling Water</I></B></P>

<P>The highly exothermic reactions require an effective cooling
medium in the shell side of the reactor to prevent runaway reactions
and hot spot formations. The chosen cooling medium chosen is water,
which enters the reactor at 187 <SUP>o</SUP>F and leaves at 366
<SUP>o</SUP>F in the form of steam. According to JChem, this method
of cooling provides the best heat transfer (4).</P>

<P>The cooling water requires a pump system to propel the water into
the shell side of the reactor. This pump system provides the
necessary cooling water to each of the four parallel reactors to
remove the heat generated by the very exothermic reaction. Four
separate pumps (one for each reactor) transport a total of 75,189
lb/hr of cooling water. This arrangement delivers an equal amount of
cooling water to each reactor and reduces the risk of complete
failure associated with the use of a single large and very expensive
pump. It is unlikely that four pumps should fail or simultaneously
need replacements. Therefore, a less expensive, smaller pump can be
used as a universal spare. Additionally, repair expenses are not as
high for smaller pumps.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><I>Materials of Construction</I></B></P>

<P>Stainless steel is chosen the tube side and carbon steel is chosen
for the shell side. There is a large amount of EO flowing through the
tube side. Since EO is very reactive with rust, the use of stainless
steel is critical to avoid a hazardous situation. Cooling water is
flowing through the shell, therefore carbon steel is suitable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Absorber Section</B></FONT></P>

<P>The reactor effluent leaves the reactor train and moves into the
absorber area, with a great deal of inert gases and unreacted
ethylene. From the reactor, the process flow enters the EO absorber,
where water removes the EO from the stream. The EO exits through the
bottom of the absorber and enters further separation and purification
steps. These further steps are not within the scope of this proposal.
The remaining components leave through the overhead of the absorber.
A portion of this overhead stream enters the CO2 removal system. This
stream serves as the recycle at the beginning of the process. Part of
the overhead from the EO absorber completely bypasses the CO2 removal
system and joins the recycle stream. The vent purges a small fraction
of the inerts in the EO absorber overhead (to prevent build up of
inerts in the stream).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Compressor Train</B></FONT></P>

<P>The compressor train increases the pressure of the recycle stream
returning to the reactor inlet, in order to achieve the reactor inlet
pressure conditions. The compressor train increases the pressure of
the stream from 223 psia to the reactor inlet condition at 261 psia.
A two-stage compression train consisting of rotary compressors
accomplishes this goal. When compared to other units such as axial,
reciprocating, and centrifugal compressors, this type of compressor
is a suitable and very economical choice. Additionally, two-stage
compression is more economical as the use of a single, much larger
compressor is very expensive due to the large pressure increase it
must produce. The process requires compressors that are sized to
achieve approximately 75% adiabatic efficiency and 75% polytropic
efficiency.</P>

<P>The reactor inlet preheater warms the reactor inlet from
181<SUP>o</SUP>F to 266<SUP>o</SUP>F, which requires a duty of 2.33e7
Btu/hr. This heat exchanger also serves to remove approximately
2.33e7 Btu/hr of heat from the reactor effluent stream, which cools
the stream from 482<SUP>o</SUP>F to 408<SUP>o</SUP>F.</P>

<P>The cooling water system around the reactor serves to remove heat
released by the reaction. This heat removal decreases the reactor
effluent temperature to 482<SUP>o</SUP>F. The heat removal required
is a duty of 8.66e7 Btu/hr. This extra heat vaporizes the cooling
water from 187<SUP>o</SUP>F to 365<SUP>o</SUP>F. The heat duty
requires a cooling water flow of 75,200 lb/hr. The water comes from
an external source. This amount of water requires 4.72e4 Btu/hr (13.8
kW), which is provided by electricity.</P>

<P>The compressor performs work on the recycle stream to increase the
pressure of the stream from 223 psia to 261 psia. Two-stage
compression, which uses electricity, provides the work. The first
stage involves a compression from 223 psia to 242 psia. This requires
3.15e6 Btu/hr (920 kW). The second stage of compression increases the
pressure from 242 psia to 261 psia. This requires 2.97e6 Btu/hr (872
kW).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><U><A NAME=safety></A></U></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><U>Safety
Concerns:</U></B></FONT></P>

<P><B>Piping</B></P>

<P>Pipelines are specifically dedicated to transportation of ethylene
oxide, due to the potential hazards of servicing the system for
multiple substances. Since carbon steel can potentially rust (which
leads to other reactions of ethylene oxide), the pipelines are
constructed of austenitic stainless steel (Type 304). Copper, silver,
magnesium, mercury and cast irons are not recommended for equipment
servicing ethylene oxide due to low ductility, acetylenic materials,
or high corrosion rates (3). The design of the piping system
minimizes low points and stagnate dead spots, to also avoid the
polymerization reaction (6). Furthermore, the surface area of the
pipe sizes will be limited by keeping the diameter and length
relatively short. High surface areas tend to lead to more
polymerization of the product. Pipelines are kept short by utilizing
a gravity drainage system where the line can be purged with
nitrogen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Flanges, O-rings, and Packing</B></P>

<P>The piping system is designed with very few flanges. At each
flange, there is a potentially hazardous leak, which could lead to
dangerous reactions in the atmosphere. The gasket material of flanges
are spiral wound stainless steel with either Teflon filler or Grafoil
GTB filler. The exact filler material of each flange are chosen
according to the temperature of the substance passing through, since
teflon is only chemically resistant to ethylene oxide up to 400-500
degrees Farenheit. For the same reason, o-rings are made of Kalrez
2035, virgin Teflon, or Chemrez 505. Only Teflon or Grafoil GTB are
for the packing material (3).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Pumps</B></P>

<P>Only carbon steel, stainless steel, or ductile iron pumps are used
in the process. Based on past experience, centrifugal pumps with
double mechanical seals are used. The seal fluid is a 50% aqueous
solution of ethylene glycol, due to its low reactivity when in
contact with ethylene oxide. The pumps are strategically placed in
curbed spots, isolated from direct process or storage units. This
decreases the risk of potential overheating, leading to ignition of
ethylene oxide vapors (3).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Valves</B></P>

<P>Valves are selected to avoid stagnate ethylene oxide in any valve
openings. As in the pipelines, these dead areas can lead to
polymerization of the chemical. For this reason, ball valves and plug
valves are not recommended for ethylene oxide service. Furthermore,
possible emissions of specific valve designs should also be
considered (3). Gate valves, globe valves, and butterfly valves are
installed at the necessary locations in the pipelines.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Insulation</B></P>

<P>The external walls of pipelines and vessels should be protected
against excessive heat, due to the possibility of ethylene oxide
decomposition. Insulation materials should be selected based on low
corrosion rates, resistance to exothermic reactions of ethylene
oxide, and durability under fire flames. In consideration of these
issues, cellular foamglass are used as insulation since it is a
closed cell material (decreasing the risk of trapping water, which
leads to exothermic reactions).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Relief Systems</B></P>

<P>The pressure relief system are designed to tie into an overall
system, which feeds to a flare. This reduces the risk for potential
exposure to people in the surrounding area. A careful analysis of the
system is performed, and relief mechanisms are designed for storage
units and piping (where stagnant liquid can gather). The relief
system is designed to avoid any possible plugging due to
polymerization. The following factors are considered (3):</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Stainless steel piping</LI>
   
   <LI>Installation of rupture disks underneath relief valves</LI>
   
   <LI>Decrease the distance between relief valves and equipment
   units</LI>
   
   <LI>Adding nitrogen to the relief valve system periodically</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Storage and Transportation</B></P>

<P>Upon production of ethylene oxide, it is transported by a railcar
to a storage area. From the railcar, the substance is pressurized
with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, and pumped into the temporary
storage tank before it is used for further chemical processing (4).
The storage vessels are designed according to ASME specifications and
constructed of stainless steel (Type 304). The tanks are externally
coated to avoid the possibility of long-term stress corrosion due to
exposure to atmospheric chlorides. The railcars and storage units are
exclusively used for ethylene oxide to reduce the risk of
contamination. The vessels are refrigerated (in the range of 20-80
<SUP>o</SUP>F) to decrease the possibility of polymerization and
control the heat of any other reactions, which might occur (3). The
ethylene oxide can also be stored longer with refrigeration. The
storage tanks are electrically grounded, placed in an area free from
possible fires, and equipped with pressure relief valves (12).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Vent Gas Scrubber</B></P>

<P>Vent gas scrubber systems are commonly used to remove ethylene
oxide from the stream. The scrubber column will be filled with pall
ring packings. The ethylene oxide is absorbed by a strong acidic
stream running countercurrent to the vent gas. Although a base can
also be used, it is not as effective as the acid (3). The scrubbed
gas is then released atmospherically and the absorbed ethylene oxide
disposed of according to environmental regulations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Prevention of Backflow</B></P>

<P>In order to prevent the possibility of backflow from downstream
processes using ethylene oxide to the storage units, a detailed
analysis is made of the piping system and vessels. Based on the
distance between units and other structures, check valves are placed
along the pipelines, particularly at the discharge site of pumps. In
the event of an incident, the system can be shut off completely at
specific spots, so as to avoid further backflow into the storage
units, which could lead to exothermic reactions and possible vessel
explosions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Operability</B></P>

<P>With all of the above safety considerations in mind during the
design phase, the process is easily operable. There are provisions
for the system in the case of shutdown, plugs in the piping system,
long-term breakdown of hardware, safer storage options, and a viable
transportation plan. In the case of a spill or leak, the possible
harmful effects are evaluated and determined to be relatively
acceptable, in consideration of the societal benefits of ethylene
oxide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><U><A NAME=econ></A></U></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><U>Economics:</U></B></FONT></P>

<P>The cost analysis of this proposal uses an operating life of 15
years, an operating year of 8000 hours, and a 15% discount factor for
the profit projections. To make it easier to compare the numbers at a
glance, most of the final values are rounded to three significant
figures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Cap Cost generates an estimate of the base cost and bare module
cost of the design hardware. The cost includes the expense of a spare
duplicate part for most of the equipment pieces. Due to storage
limitations and expense, jEO generally includes only one spare for
each equipment type. Table 6 lists the specific costs. Davis
Corporation specifically requests that the preliminary cost analysis
does not account for the absorption system.</P>

<P>Table 13 lists the annual cash flows of the proposed design
process. The projected construction period is 2 years, with a
discount factor of 15%. With an operating life of 15 years and an
operating year of 8000 hours, the necessary labor is calculated (14).
The cash flow accounts for the 1% inflation rate of the price of
ethylene oxide versus the 3% inflation rate of the reactants (6). As
expected, the discounted cash flow value decreases steadily each year
(see Figure 4). In addition to the expense of the reactants, the
other costs of manufacturing, such as labor, operation overhead,
utilities, and maintenance, are also subtracted from the annual sales
revenue to arrive at the annual cash flow value. There is a profit of
almost $48 million in the third year (see Table 13). This profit
continues to grow to over $350 million in the last operating year.
The final cumulative discounted cash flow continues to grow beyond
$350 million in the last year (see Figure 5).</P>

<P>In conclusion, jEO &amp; Associates has determined that it is
profitable to enter the EO market by constructing a plant that will
come on-line in two years. jEO has developed the most profitable
reactor train design possible. The process design focuses on a
four-reactor train utilizing the typical Shell direct oxidation
catalyst. The process produces</P>

<P>150,000 tons of EO per year. Considering mainly the reactor
section of the process, the capital cost involved is $9.3 million,
the yearly operating cost is $92 million, and the final cumulative
discounted cash flow is $350 million. These results show that
construction should begin immediately in order to start-up in two
years.</P>
